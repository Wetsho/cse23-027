              **Rachel Green**: A fashion enthusiast and Monica's best friend from childhood. Rachel starts the series by running away from her wedding and moving in with Monica. She begins working as a waitress at Central Perk, the group's favorite coffee shop, and eventually pursues a career in fashion, working her way up from a personal shopper at Bloomingdale's to an executive at Ralph Lauren.
