                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                The Dark Knight is a 2008 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan and based on the DC Comics character Batman. Produced by Legendary Pictures, Syncopy, and DC Comics, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the second installment in Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and the sequel to Batman Begins (2005). The film stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman. In the film, Batman, with the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, sets out to dismantle the remaining criminal organizations that plague Gotham City. However, the emergence of a new criminal mastermind known as the Joker throws Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman closer to crossing the fine line between hero and vigilante.

                <h1>PLOT</h1>
                In Gotham City, the Joker and his accomplices rob a mob-owned bank. Batman and Lieutenant Jim Gordon decide to include the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, in their plan to eradicate the mob. Bruce Wayne is impressed with Dent's idealism and offers to support his career. Despite Rachel Dawes, Bruce's childhood friend, now dating Dent, Bruce believes that with Dent as Gotham's protector, he can give up being Batman and lead a normal life with Rachel.
                The mob bosses, desperate to protect their money, meet with the Joker, who offers to kill Batman in exchange for half of their money. Joker starts a crime spree across Gotham, killing police commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trials. He also targets Dent, but Gordon sacrifices himself to save Dent. Rachel is also kidnapped by the Joker, who rigs two buildings with explosives.
                Batman interrogates Joker, who reveals that Rachel and Dent are in separate locations rigged with explosives. Batman races to save Rachel while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at Dent's location instead of Rachel's, and both buildings explode. Rachel dies, and Dent sustains severe burns to the left side of his face, leaving him disfigured.
                The Joker escapes with Lau, the mob's accountant, and burns Lau along with the mob's money. Bruce decides to reveal his identity to stop the Joker's killing spree. Before he can, Dent announces that he is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker manages to capture him. The Joker then reveals that both Dent and Rachel are in separate locations filled with explosives.
                Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals their locations. Batman races to save Rachel while Gordon goes after Dent. Batman ends up saving Dent, and the explosives kill Rachel. Dent's face is severely burned on one side, and he becomes vengeful. The Joker escapes with Lau and burns him on top of a pile of the mob's money.
                The Joker blackmails Batman into revealing his identity and kills several people, including Commissioner Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trials. Wayne Enterprises accountant Coleman Reese deduces Batman's identity and plans to reveal it on television, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon and Batman thwart the Joker's plans, but the Joker escapes, taking a busload of hostages with him.
                Dent, now calling himself Two-Face, goes on a killing spree, targeting people he holds responsible for Rachel's death. He confronts Gordon and his family, intending to kill them. Batman arrives and pleads with Dent to spare them. Two-Face decides their fate with the flip of a coin. Before he can determine their fate, Batman tackles Dent off a building, killing him.
                To protect Dent's reputation and ensure that the city remains hopeful, Batman takes the blame for the killing spree and becomes a fugitive. Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal and launches a manhunt for Batman. As he flees, Alfred burns a letter from Rachel telling Bruce she planned to marry Dent. Lucius Fox watches as the sonar system self-destructs. The film ends with Gordon's son asking why Batman is running, to which Gordon replies that Batman is a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a Dark Knight.
